# Web App for EDA, Visualization, and Classification

This web app is built using Streamlit and provides a user-friendly interface for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, and training classification models on your dataset. It allows you to upload your own dataset, explore its features, visualize relationships, and evaluate various classification algorithms.

## Features

The web app offers the following features:

1. **EDA**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on your uploaded dataset, including summary statistics, missing values, and data distribution.

2. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations such as pair plots to explore relationships between features, histograms, scatter plots, and more.

3. **Model Training and Testing**: Train and test classification models on your dataset using the following algorithms:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree

4. **About Me**: Get to know the developer behind this web app. The "About Me" section includes links to their GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter profiles.
